This drama, based on the writer’s experience of seeking support for someone with early-onset Alzheimer's, features the frustrations and difficulties encountered on the journey from initial symptoms to eventual diagnosis. It explores gentle William’s interactions with interested parties – GP, fraudster, social worker, etc – as he faces his changing reality. The play aims to provide an entertaining, thought-provoking, occasionally humorous audience experience in its depiction of the impact of encroaching dementia on an intelligent, independent individual.; Category: Theatre",
